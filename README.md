# StartMap – Mapping your Startup Journey 
Make starting up in India simple, guided, and stress-free.

We noticed that most aspiring entrepreneurs — especially in Tier 2 and 3 cities — have the drive, but get stuck in the maze of registrations, licenses, and legal terms. Government portals are scattered, and advisors are either costly or out of reach.

So we created StartMap — your AI-powered startup companion that helps you:

Understand exactly what licenses and documents you need, step-by-step

Auto-fill and simplify government forms with voice assistance and smart logic

Visualize your startup journey with clear flowcharts and milestones

Get matched with the right schemes, mentors, and investors based on your goals

We designed StartMap to be as smart as your ideas and as simple as your intent — reliable, inclusive, and empowering.

"It’s not just an app. It’s your co-founder for all things legal, formal, and foundational."
